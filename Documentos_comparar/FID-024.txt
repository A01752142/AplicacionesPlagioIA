Fuzzy logic is a vital component in artificial intelligence (AI) for managing uncertainty and vagueness, facilitating more flexible and human-like decision-making. This paper examines the integration of fuzzy logic into AI systems, focusing on its use in control systems, decision support, and pattern recognition. By utilizing fuzzy sets and membership functions, AI can effectively handle imprecise information. The study highlights practical applications in fields such as robotics and healthcare, demonstrating how fuzzy logic enhances system adaptability and robustness. Despite challenges like computational demands and the need for expert rule definitions, fuzzy logic remains a powerful tool for improving AI functionality in complex, real-world environments.
