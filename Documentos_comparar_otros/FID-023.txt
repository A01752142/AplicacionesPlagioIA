Fuzzy logic has emerged as a critical tool in artificial intelligence (AI) for handling uncertainty and imprecision, which are inherent in real-world scenarios. This paper explores the application of fuzzy logic in AI, highlighting its advantages in decision-making processes, control systems, and pattern recognition. Fuzzy logic provides a framework for reasoning about data that is not precise, enabling AI systems to make more human-like decisions by accommodating ambiguity. We review the theoretical foundations of fuzzy logic, including fuzzy sets, membership functions, and inference mechanisms, and demonstrate how these concepts are integrated into AI algorithms. Case studies in areas such as robotics, medical diagnosis, and intelligent transportation systems are presented to illustrate the practical benefits and versatility of fuzzy logic in AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of implementing fuzzy logic, such as computational complexity and the need for expert knowledge in defining rules and membership functions. By analyzing recent advancements and potential future developments, this research underscores the pivotal role of fuzzy logic in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of AI systems.
